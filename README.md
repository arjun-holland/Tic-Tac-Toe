# Tic Tac Toe - C++ Game
# Overview
This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game written in C++. It allows two players to play the classic 3x3 grid-based game. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

# Features
2-player gameplay (no AI).
Input validation to ensure valid moves.
Displays the current game board after each turn.
Detects the winner or a draw at the end of the game.
# Prerequisites
To run this game, you need:

A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
Basic knowledge of how to compile and run C++ programs.

# How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their symbol (either X or O) in an empty cell.
Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
- The game continues until a player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the game ends in a draw.
- The game board is printed after every move, so players can see the current state of the game.
# Game Flow

- Player 1 starts by selecting an empty cell to place an X.
- Player 2 follows and places an O.
- The game checks after each move whether there is a winner or a draw.
- The game ends when there is a winner or when all cells are filled with no winner (draw).
